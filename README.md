- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the analysis and repository.

## Analysis Steps

The analysis follows these main steps:

1. Data Cleaning: The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, extract relevant columns, and convert currency values to USD.
2. Salary Analysis: The distribution of salaries is explored through visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and summary statistics.
3. Employment Status: The employment status of developers is visualized using a pie chart to show the proportion of remote work and full-time employment.
4. Programming Languages: The most popular programming languages among developers are identified and visualized using a pie chart and bar chart.
5. Education Level: The educational background of developers is analyzed and visualized through a pie chart to show the distribution of education levels.
6. Gender Differences: The income difference between male and female developers is analyzed and visualized using bar charts.
7. Other Analyses: Additional analyses such as age distribution and years of experience are explored and visualized using appropriate charts.

## Dependencies

The analysis code is written in Python and requires the following dependencies:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
